# GKringsig
groth-kohlweiss ring signatures in solidity with backend in go!
paper can be found [here](https://eprint.iacr.org/2014/764). Signatures are logarithmic
in number of participants, and can be altered from the paper constuction to require
only the random oracle model (rather than existing in the common reference or random
string models).

User tools coming soon (TM).
